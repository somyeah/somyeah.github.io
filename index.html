                    <p>It's nice to meet you. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science. Now I work as a software engineer in San Francisco, CA. To shapen my technical skillset, I'm pursuing an online certification in Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University. I would best describe myself as a backend engineer with a specific interest in big data, natural language processing, AI, and machine learning. My technical acumen has been shaped by working in highly regulated industries, such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I try to keep my body active with dance, running, hiking, yoga, and playing soccer with friends at Golden Gate Park. I enjoy reading fiction, cooking vegetarian food, and learning new things.</p>
                    <p>While I'm not a seasoned web developer, I built this website to showcase my skills and provide myself with an outlet. Most of my previous projects are not open-source, but expect to see more updates coming soon!</p>

                    <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Software Engineer, <a href="https://saama.com/" target="_blank">Saama</a></h3>
                    <p>I collaborated closely with pharmaceutical firms to accelerate clinical trials and manage HIPAA-compliant data for drug discovery and development. As the team's backend and data engineer, I contributed to platforms that automated clinical data management practices, identified protocol deviations from study procedures, and expedited medical coding and translation processes. Together, we accelerated Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine trials by one month thanks to the automation of data cleaning and review processes.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Data Science Fellow, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></h3>
                    <p>As a part of the <a href="https://codingitforward.com/fellowship" target="_blank">the Civic Digital Fellowship</a>, I trained an autoencoder model for the Occupational Requirements Survey program. I built an ML algorithm to extract and classify tasks for each job entry using logistic regression and stochastic gradient descent with an accuracy rate of 90% on ORS data paired with private sector data.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Local Government Relations Director, <a href="https://asuc.org/" target="_blank">Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC)</a></h3>
                    <p>I was appointed to supervise all advocacy work focused on the City of Berkeley. As director, I developed the office’s advocacy strategy for items related to housing, homelessness, public transportation, urban infrastructure, climate change, and the UC Berkeley student body at-large. I also built and maintained strong relationships with city officials, neighborhood officials, and community organizations.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Data Science Researcher, <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/pradeep-chhibber" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Department of Political Science</a></h3>
                    <p>I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized a dataset of 5000 temples, dating back to 1970, to quantify socioeconomic disparities between Indian villages using factors such as age, size, wetlands, and infrastructure. I also structured and analyzed data from 40+ districts in Uttar Pradesh to study relationships between socioeconomic factors (gender, age, and caste) and the deprivation of resources (sanitation and education).</p>

                    <h2>My Side Projects</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Twitter Sentiment Analysis Tool</h3>
                    <p>I pulled some public data using the wrapper around the Twitter API and performed sentiment analysis on public users' tweets. I built a web application using AWS, Flask, HTML, and CSS to display the most recent 100 tweets from any given user, as well as their followees and followers.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Article Recommender System</h3>
                    <p>I developed a recommendation engine on a dataset of 2000 BBC articles (approximately 1000 words per document) using word2vec and GloVe to generate word embeddings. I efficiently loaded the word embeddings (6B tokens, 400K-word vocabulary, 300 dimensions) in memory on 4GB RAM AWS instance to compute online recommendations.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Patient Management Database</h3>
                    <p>I built a proof-of-concept web application that displays and manages critical patient data, with simple field equality search and field filtering options.</p>
