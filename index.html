                    <p>It's nice to meet you. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2020 with a degree in Cognitive Science, and now I work as a software engineer in San Francisco, CA. To sharpen my technical skillset, I'm also pursuing an online graduate certificate in Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University.</p>
                    <p>I would best describe myself as a backend engineer with an interest in big data, natural language processing, machine learning, and AI ethics. My technical acumen has been shaped by navigating highly-regulated, impact-driven industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, defense, and aerospace.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I keep my body active with dance, running, yoga, and hiking in the California redwoods. I enjoy reading fiction with my book club, cooking vegetarian food, writing short stories, and advocating for reproductive rights and social equity. And, for those interested: I'm an Aries sun, Capricorn moon, and Leo rising.</p>
                    <p>While I'm not a seasoned web developer, I built this website to showcase my skills and provide myself with an outlet. Most of my previous projects are not open-source, but expect to see more updates coming soon!</p>
                    <p>For a more formal introduction, please check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pR956V712ED9BHJQtTuvVIALdCzkChfzsJxDo-vdwZE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/somyajain98/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

                    <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3>Forward Deployed ML Engineer, <a href="https://deepedge.ai/" target="_blank">DeepEdge</a></h3>
                    <p>At DeepEdge, I closely worked with defense partners on critical missions of geopolitical importance and security. I trained and evaluated AI pipelines built with sophisticated methodologies in computer vision for multi-object detection and tracking. </p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Software Engineer, <a href="https://saama.com/" target="_blank">Saama</a></h3>
                    <p>I collaborated closely with pharmaceutical firms to accelerate clinical trials and manage HIPAA-compliant data for drug discovery and development. As the team's backend and data engineer, I contributed to platforms that automated clinical data management practices, identified protocol deviations from study procedures, and expedited medical coding and translation processes. This involved building backend web services, data pipelines, ML and NLP models, and internal tools for data integrity. Together, we accelerated Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine trials by one month.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Data Science Fellow, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></h3>
                    <p>As a part of <a href="https://codingitforward.com/fellowship" target="_blank">the Civic Digital Fellowship</a>, I trained an autoencoder model for the Occupational Requirements Survey program. I built an ML algorithm to extract and classify tasks for each job entry using logistic regression and stochastic gradient descent with an accuracy rate of 90% on ORS data paired with private sector data.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Local Government Relations Director, <a href="https://asuc.org/" target="_blank">Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC)</a></h3>
                    <p>I was appointed to supervise all advocacy work focused on the City of Berkeley. As director, I developed the office’s advocacy strategy for items related to housing, homelessness, public transportation, urban infrastructure, climate change, and the UC Berkeley student body at-large. I also built and maintained strong relationships with city officials, neighborhood officials, and community organizations.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Data Science Researcher, <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/pradeep-chhibber" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Department of Political Science</a></h3>
                    <p>I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized datasets of 5000 temples, dating back to 1970, to quantify socioeconomic disparities between Indian villages using factors such as age, size, wetlands, and infrastructure. I also structured and analyzed data from 40+ districts in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest province, to study relationships between socioeconomic factors (gender, age, and caste) and the deprivation of resources (sanitation and education).</p>

                    <h2>My Side Projects</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/somyeah/sentiment" target="_blank">Twitter Sentiment Analysis Tool</a></h3>
                    <p>I pulled some public data using the wrapper around the Twitter API and performed sentiment analysis on public users' tweets. I built a web application using AWS, Flask, HTML, and CSS to display the most recent 100 tweets from any given user, as well as their followees and followers.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/somyeah/recommender" target="_blank">Article Recommender System</a></h3>
                    <p>I developed a recommendation engine on a dataset of 2000 BBC articles (approximately 1000 words per document) using word2vec and GloVe to generate word embeddings. I efficiently loaded the word embeddings (6B tokens, 400K-word vocabulary, 300 dimensions) in memory on a 4GB RAM AWS instance to compute online recommendations.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Patient Management Database</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/somyeah/patient-management-frontend" target="_blank">Frontend</a> | <a href="https://github.com/somyeah/patient-management-backend" target="_blank">Backend</a></p>
                    <p>I built a proof-of-concept web application that displays and manages critical patient data, with simple field equality search and field filtering options.</p>
